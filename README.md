# React Test Study

The study projects from Educative.

## Module 1 - Test-Driven Development with React

- [x] Test Driven Development with Jest

  The content is under `jest-test` folder

- [x] Integrated Tooling with VSCode

  The content is under `eslint-integration` folder

- [x] Testing React with Enzyme

  The content is under `enzyme-test` folder with some updates. The content from course taught the test in component based development. As component based development is not popular anymore, I rewrote the last fraction into functional based component.

  May not be 100% correct with the FP testing.

- [x] Styling in JavaScript with Styled-Components

  Refer to the `enzyme-test`.

  ‚ùå Note that the testing for styled-component is somewhat incomplete. The original articla studied on how to compolete styled-component in class-based-component, yet not touched the functional component.

- [ ] Refactoring with HOC

  The Hook implementation might be able to bypass the HOC within this version. For example, instead of wrapping components with components, potentially we can write some smaller functional component to change the props or internal state.
