# React Test Study

The study projects from Educative.

## Module 1 - Test-Driven Development with React

- [x] Test Driven Development with Jest

  The content is under `jest-test` folder

- [x] Integrated Tooling with VSCode

  The content is under `eslint-integration` folder

- [x] Testing React with Enzyme

  The content is under `enzyme-test` folder with some updates. The content from course taught the test in component based development. As component based development is not popular anymore, I rewrote the last fraction into functional based component.

  May not be 100% correct with the FP testing.
